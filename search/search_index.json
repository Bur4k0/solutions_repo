Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic example of motion under constant acceleration, where the only force acting is gravity (assuming no air resistance for now). We derive the equations from first principles using Newton\u2019s second law. Governing Equations In a 2D Cartesian coordinate system: Horizontal motion: No forces act, so acceleration \\(a_x = 0\\) and velocity remains constant: \\(v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) \\(x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t\\) Vertical motion: Gravity acts downward with acceleration \\(a_y = -g\\) : \\(v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t\\) \\(y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) These parametric equations describe a parabolic trajectory. Family of Solutions The trajectory depends on initial conditions: - Higher \\(v_0\\) results in a larger range and peak height. - Changing \\(\\theta\\) alters the steepness and symmetry. - Varying \\(g\\) (e.g., on the Moon, \\(g \\approx 1.6 \\text{ m/s}^2\\) ) changes the scale. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance when \\(y = 0\\) (assuming equal launch and landing height). Time of Flight Setting \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solving for \\(t\\) : \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) Range Equation Substituting into \\(x(t)\\) : \\(R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\) Dependence on Parameters Maximum Range: Achieved at \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , with \\(R_{\\max} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g}\\) . Initial Velocity: Range scales with \\(v_0^2\\) , so doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples \\(R\\) . Gravity: Lower \\(g\\) results in a longer range. 3. Practical Applications This model applies to: - Sports: Basketball shots, soccer kicks, javelin throws. - Engineering: Artillery trajectories, water fountains. - Astrophysics: Lunar landings, planetary surface exploration. Extensions: Uneven Terrain: Adjusts time of flight using \\(y(t) = -h\\) . Air Resistance: Introduces drag, requiring numerical solutions.
