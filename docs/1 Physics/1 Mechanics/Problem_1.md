# Projectile Motion Analysis and Simulation,


## 1. Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion is a classic example of motion under constant acceleration, where the only force acting is gravity (assuming no air resistance for now). We derive the equations from first principles using Newtonâ€™s second law.

### Governing Equations

In a 2D Cartesian coordinate system:

- **Horizontal motion:** No forces act, so acceleration $a_x = 0$ and velocity remains constant:
  $v_x = v_0 \cos\theta$
  $x(t) = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t$

- **Vertical motion:** Gravity acts downward with acceleration $a_y = -g$:
  $v_y = v_0 \sin\theta - g t$
  $y(t) = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$

These parametric equations describe a parabolic trajectory.

### Family of Solutions

The trajectory depends on initial conditions:

- Higher $v_0$ results in a larger range and peak height.
- Changing $\theta$ alters the steepness and symmetry.
- Varying $g$ (e.g., on the Moon, $g \approx 1.6 \text{ m/s}^2$) changes the scale.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

The range $R$ is the horizontal distance when $y = 0$ (assuming equal launch and landing height).

### Time of Flight
Setting $y(t) = 0$ and solving for $t$:
$t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}$

### Range Equation
Substituting into $x(t)$:
$R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}$

### Dependence on Parameters
- **Maximum Range:** Achieved at $\theta = 45^\circ$, with $R_{\max} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}$.
- **Initial Velocity:** Range scales with $v_0^2$, so doubling $v_0$ quadruples $R$.
- **Gravity:** Lower $g$ results in a longer range.

## 3. Practical Applications

This model applies to:
- **Sports:** Basketball shots, soccer kicks, javelin throws.
- **Engineering:** Artillery trajectories, water fountains.
- **Astrophysics:** Lunar landings, planetary surface exploration.

### Extensions:
- **Uneven Terrain:** Adjusts time of flight using $y(t) = -h$.
- **Air Resistance:** Introduces drag, requiring numerical solutions.
