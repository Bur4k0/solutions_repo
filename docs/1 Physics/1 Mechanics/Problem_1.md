# Problem 1
# Projectile Motion Analysis and Simulation

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion is a classic example of motion under constant acceleration, where the only force acting is gravity (assuming no air resistance for now). We derive the equations from first principles using Newtonâ€™s second law.

### Governing Equations

In a 2D Cartesian coordinate system:

- **Horizontal motion:** No forces act, so acceleration $a_x = 0$ and velocity remains constant:
  $v_x = v_0 \cos\theta$
  $x(t) = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t$

- **Vertical motion:** Gravity acts downward with acceleration $a_y = -g$:
  $v_y = v_0 \sin\theta - g t$
  $y(t) = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$

These parametric equations describe a parabolic trajectory.

### Family of Solutions

The trajectory depends on initial conditions:
- Higher $v_0$ results in a larger range and peak height.
- Changing $\theta$ alters the steepness and symmetry.
- Varying $g$ (e.g., on the Moon, $g \approx 1.6 \text{ m/s}^2$) changes the scale.

## 2. Analysis of the Range

The range $R$ is the horizontal distance when $y = 0$ (assuming equal launch and landing height).

### Time of Flight
Setting $y(t) = 0$ and solving for $t$:
$t = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}$

### Range Equation
Substituting into $x(t)$:
$R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}$

### Dependence on Parameters
- **Maximum Range:** Achieved at $\theta = 45^\circ$, with $R_{\max} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}$.
- **Initial Velocity:** Range scales with $v_0^2$, so doubling $v_0$ quadruples $R$.
- **Gravity:** Lower $g$ results in a longer range.

## 3. Practical Applications

This model applies to:
- **Sports:** Basketball shots, soccer kicks, javelin throws.
- **Engineering:** Artillery trajectories, water fountains.
- **Astrophysics:** Lunar landings, planetary surface exploration.

### Extensions:
- **Uneven Terrain:** Adjusts time of flight using $y(t) = -h$.
- **Air Resistance:** Introduces drag, requiring numerical solutions.

## 4. Implementation

We develop a Python simulation to visualize projectile motion.

### Python Code for Simulation

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def projectile_motion(v0, theta, g=9.81, dt=0.01):
    theta_rad = np.radians(theta)
    vx, vy = v0 * np.cos(theta_rad), v0 * np.sin(theta_rad)
    x, y, t = [0], [0], 0
    while y[-1] >= 0:
        t += dt
        x.append(vx * t)
        y.append(vy * t - 0.5 * g * t**2)
    return x, y

v0 = 20  # Initial velocity
angles = [30, 45, 60]
plt.figure()
for angle in angles:
    x, y = projectile_motion(v0, angle)
    plt.plot(x, y, label=f"{angle} degrees")
plt.xlabel("Horizontal Distance (m)")
plt.ylabel("Vertical Distance (m)")
plt.legend()
plt.title("Projectile Motion for Different Angles")
plt.show()
```

### Graphical Representation

The simulation plots projectile motion for different angles, illustrating how range varies with initial conditions.

### Limitations and Realistic Extensions

- **Idealized Assumptions:** No air resistance, flat terrain.
- **Realistic Factors:** Wind, drag force, varying gravity.
- **Numerical Methods:** Required for solving equations with air resistance.
