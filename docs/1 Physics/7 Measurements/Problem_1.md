### Procedure

#### Materials
- **String**: 1 or 1.5 meters long.
- **Weight**: Small object (e.g., bag of coins, bag of sugar, key chain).
- **Stopwatch**: Smartphone timer or dedicated stopwatch.
- **Ruler or Measuring Tape**: For measuring pendulum length.

#### Setup
1. **Pendulum Assembly**:
   - Attach the weight to one end of the string.
   - Secure the other end to a sturdy support (e.g., a clamp or hook).
2. **Length Measurement**:
   - Measure the pendulum length $L$, from the suspension point to the center of the weight.
   - Use a ruler or measuring tape and note its resolution (e.g., 1 mm = 0.001 m).
   - Uncertainty in length: $\delta L = \frac{\text{resolution}}{2}$ (e.g., for 1 mm resolution, $\delta L = 0.0005 \, \text{m}$).

#### Data Collection
1. **Oscillation Measurement**:
   - Displace the pendulum by a small angle (<15°) to ensure simple harmonic motion.
   - Release and measure the time for **10 full oscillations** (one oscillation is a complete back-and-forth cycle).
   - Repeat this measurement **10 times**, recording each time $t_i$ (for 10 oscillations).
2. **Timing Uncertainty**:
   - Calculate the **mean time** for 10 oscillations: $\bar{t} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} t_i$.
   - Calculate the **standard deviation** of the 10 measurements: $\sigma_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9} \sum_{i=1}^{10} (t_i - \bar{t})^2}$.
   - Uncertainty in the mean time: $\delta \bar{t} = \frac{\sigma_t}{\sqrt{10}}$.

### Calculations

#### 1. Calculate the Period
- **Period** $T$: The time for one oscillation.
  $T = \frac{\bar{t}}{10}$
- **Uncertainty in Period** $\delta T$:
  $\delta T = \frac{\delta \bar{t}}{10}$

#### 2. Determine $g$
- The period of a simple pendulum is given by:
  $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$
- Solving for $g$:
  $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2}$

#### 3. Propagate Uncertainties
- The uncertainty in $g$ is found using error propagation. The relative uncertainty in $g$ is:
  $\frac{\delta g}{g} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\delta T}{T} \right)^2}$
- Absolute uncertainty:
  $\delta g = g \cdot \frac{\delta g}{g}$

### Example Data and Analysis

Since no specific data is provided, I’ll assume typical experimental values to demonstrate the process. You can replace these with your actual measurements.

#### Assumed Data
- **Pendulum Length**: $L = 1.000 \, \text{m}$, measured with a ruler of 1 mm resolution.
  - Uncertainty: $\delta L = \frac{0.001}{2} = 0.0005 \, \text{m}$.
- **Time for 10 Oscillations** (10 trials, in seconds):
  $t_i = [20.12, 20.08, 20.15, 20.10, 20.09, 20.11, 20.13, 20.07, 20.14, 20.10]$

#### Step-by-Step Calculations
1. **Mean Time**:
   $\bar{t} = \frac{20.12 + 20.08 + 20.15 + 20.10 + 20.09 + 20.11 + 20.13 + 20.07 + 20.14 + 20.10}{10} = 20.109 \, \text{s}$

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   $\sigma_t = \sqrt{\frac{(20.12-20.109)^2 + (20.08-20.109)^2 + \dots + (20.10-20.109)^2}{9}} \approx 0.026 \, \text{s}$

3. **Uncertainty in Mean Time**:
   $\delta \bar{t} = \frac{\sigma_t}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{0.026}{\sqrt{10}} \approx 0.0082 \, \text{s}$

4. **Period**:
   $T = \frac{\bar{t}}{10} = \frac{20.109}{10} = 2.0109 \, \text{s}$
   $\delta T = \frac{\delta \bar{t}}{10} = \frac{0.0082}{10} = 0.00082 \, \text{s}$

5. **Gravitational Acceleration**:
   $g = \frac{4\pi^2 L}{T^2} = \frac{4 \cdot (3.14159)^2 \cdot 1.000}{(2.0109)^2} \approx \frac{39.4784}{4.0437} \approx 9.763 \, \text{m/s}^2$

6. **Uncertainty Propagation**:
   - Relative uncertainty in $L$:
     $\frac{\delta L}{L} = \frac{0.0005}{1.000} = 0.0005$
   - Relative uncertainty in $T$:
     $\frac{\delta T}{T} = \frac{0.00082}{2.0109} \approx 0.000408$
   - Relative uncertainty in $g$:
     $\frac{\delta g}{g} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{\delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \frac{\delta T}{T} \right)^2} = \sqrt{(0.0005)^2 + (2 \cdot 0.000408)^2} = \sqrt{0.00025 + 0.000665} \approx 0.000915$
   - Absolute uncertainty:
     $\delta g = g \cdot \frac{\delta g}{g} = 9.763 \cdot 0.000915 \approx 0.0089 \, \text{m/s}^2$

7. **Final Result**:
   $g = 9.763 \pm 0.009 \, \text{m/s}^2$

#### 2. Discussion on Sources of Uncertainty and Their Impact

- **Comparison with Standard Value**:
  - The calculated $g = 9.763 \pm 0.009 \, \text{m/s}^2$ is close to the standard value of $g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$. The discrepancy (0.047 m/s²) is slightly larger than the uncertainty, suggesting possible systematic errors or local variations in $g$.

- **Effect of Measurement Resolution on $L$**:
  - The ruler’s resolution (1 mm) results in $\delta L = 0.0005 \, \text{m}$. For $L = 1.000 \, \text{m}$, this contributes a relative uncertainty of 0.05%. This is small but affects $g$ directly, as $g \propto L$. Using a more precise tool (e.g., caliper with 0.1 mm resolution) would reduce this uncertainty.

- **Variability in Timing and Impact on $T$**:
  - The standard deviation of the timing measurements ($\sigma_t = 0.026 \, \text{s}$) reflects human reaction time or inconsistent pendulum release. The uncertainty in $T$ ($\delta T = 0.00082 \, \text{s}$) contributes a relative uncertainty of 0.04% to $T$, but since $g \propto \frac{1}{T^2}$, the effect is amplified (0.08% in $g$). Measuring more oscillations per trial (e.g., 20 instead of 10) could reduce $\delta \bar{t}$.

- **Assumptions and Experimental Limitations**:
  - **Small-Angle Approximation**: The formula $T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$ assumes small angles (<15°). Larger angles introduce non-linear effects, slightly increasing $T$ and underestimating $g$.
  - **Air Resistance and Friction**: Air drag and pivot friction were neglected, which could dampen oscillations and increase $T$, reducing $g$.
  - **Mass Distribution**: The weight was assumed to be a point mass. If the weight is extended (e.g., a bag of coins), the effective length may differ from the measured $L$.
  - **Local $g$ Variations**: The true $g$ varies slightly with location (e.g., altitude, latitude). The standard 9.81 m/s² is an average, and local $g$ may differ.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Use a metronome or automated release mechanism to reduce timing variability.
  - Conduct the experiment in a vacuum or low-air-resistance environment to minimize damping.
  - Measure $L$ with higher precision and ensure the weight approximates a point mass.
  - Compare results with a local $g$ value (e.g., from geophysical data) for better accuracy assessment.
